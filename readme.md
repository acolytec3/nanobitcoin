Inspired by [Daniel van Flymen](https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46) and written to run on [Debian on Termux](https://github.com/sp4rkie/debian-on-termux)

Features
* Allows basic mining
* Very basic, brute force transaction validation that tries to ensure any sending address has enough nanobitcoin to send to any new address
Will hopefully grow beyond this as I experiment and learn about blockchain.
